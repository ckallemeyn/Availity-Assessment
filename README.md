# Availity-Assessment

please see the ```short_answer.md``` file for the first three prompts.

  ### Exercise-1 
   - please see the folder for my solution to the "balanced parenthesis" problem.
  ### Exercise-2-React
   - In order to see my work for this exercise please run ```npm run start``` and ```npm run build``` in dual terminal windows.
   - This will start the Express.js server and will allow you to view my work at ```localhost:3007```.
  ### Exercise-3
   - I chose to do this exercise in Node.js as I was unsure if this was meant to be a Java ,or Node, specific exercise. 
   - Additionally, I chose to write the csv file to a JSON file as I did not know what file type the CSV data should be converted to. 
   - To see my work you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine, and then run ```node csvConverter.js``` in the Exercise 3  directory.
