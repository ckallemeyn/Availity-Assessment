### Prompt 1
 - Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can be a personal or school project.  
  
  One of the proudest moments of my life was the completion of my Masters degree. To some this may seem like a great moment for anyone, but for me this was on par with summiting Mt. Kilimanjaro. I struggled with severe mental health issues through my two years at the University of North Texas. I remember the Spring semester of my first year during Spring Break, I was exhausted both mentally and physically. Between working part-time and going to school full-time I was not allowing myself proper rest and self-care. As a result of this, I slipped into a deep stage of burn-out which progressed to a 5 month long depression.  Up until this point I never truly understood depression. Some of my fellow students would use the term casually when they were sad, or were having a hard time. However, during this period of my life I can attest that depression is a real issue, and it can be a terrifying experience. Most of the mornings during my burnout I felt this heavy weight on me, and felt as if I couldn’t physically get out of bed. I missed quite a few classes due to my mental state, and it led to the fear of me dropping out, but with the support of my friends and family I stuck out the spring semester. During the summer between my first and second year I took a lot of time off away from anything school related and started to find ways to get back to a healthy mental state. By changing my diet, exercising consistently through the week, practicing mediation, and seeking professional help I was able to not only complete my degree by finish out my time at UNT with a 4.0 GPA. The moment that I walked across the stage at my graduation ceremony I felt nothing, but overwhelming joy that I had made it and overcame so many obstacles to get to that point. I will never forget that moment.
  

### Prompt 2
  - Tell me a about a book, blog, article or GitHub repo you read or liked recently, and why you like it and why you should recommend I do the same. 
   
   A Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl is by far one of the most influential reads that I've read lately. I personally do not re-read books often, and if I do I will only read portions of books. However, This novel is life changing and I have re-read it 3 times now. It redefined the term "success" for me, and gave me a new perspective on living when faced with adversity. Without a shred of doubt this book will give you invaluable perspectives told from a prisoner in a Nazi conc
concentration camp. I often go back to this quote for motivation against adversity, "In accepting this challenge to suffer bravely, life has a meaning up to the last moment, and it retains this meaning literally to the end."
